from rtree import index
#After importing the index module, construct an index with the default construction:
idx = index.Index()
#After instantiating the index, create a bounding box that we can insert into the index:
left, bottom, right, top = (1, 5, 5, 10)
#Insert an entry into the index using idx.insert(index,bounding box)

%%your code is here

left, bottom, right, top = (6, 10, 11, 20)
#Insert another entry into the index using idx.insert(index+1,bounding box)

%%your code is here

#searching rectangle area
search_rectangle=(6,11,11,21)
#use list(list(idx.intersection())) to return the dataobject whose bounding box overlap with the search rectangle

%%your code is here
return_list=
#print the index overlap with searching area)
print(return_list)
